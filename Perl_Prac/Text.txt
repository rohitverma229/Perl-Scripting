A text file (sometimes spelled textfile; an old alternative name is flatfile)
is a kind of computer file that is structured as a sequence of lines of electronic text.
A text file exists stored as data within a computer file system.
In operating systems such as CP/M and MS-DOS, 
where the operating system does not keep track of the file size in bytes, 
the end of a text file is denoted by placing one or more special characters,
known as an end-of-file marker, as padding after the last line in a text file.
